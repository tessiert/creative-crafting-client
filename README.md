# In-progress portfolio project for the Nucamp Fullstack Bootcamp

As of now, this is mainly a front-end application created using React and several
supporting packages.  My main remaining tasks are to create a backend using MongoDB and to
implement the shopping cart and ratings/reviews functionality.  The current state of the 
project can be viewed at https://creativecrafting.dreamhosters.com
