This repository contains the front end piece of an online storefront for the display and purchase of handcrafted items (crochet hats, necklaces, keychains, etc).  It is written as a Single Page App in ReactJS, Redux, Javascript, and ReactStrap.  The shopping cart employs use_local_storage_state and is integrated with a payment gateway using the react_paypal_js package.

The image galleries are created using custom React components styled with CSS, I used nuka-carousel for the image carousel on the homepage, and the lightboxes on the product detail pages are implemented using fslightbox-react.
The server portion to which it connects (for user autentication, database access, user reviews and orders info., etc.) can be found in my [creative_crafting_server](https://github.com/tessiert/creative_crafting_server) repository on GitHub.

The site is hosted at https://creativecrafting.dreamhosters.com.
